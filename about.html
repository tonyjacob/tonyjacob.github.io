## About

I am a recent engineering graduate from the University of Waterloo. I am fascinated by consumer products, user behavior, analytics, elegant solution designs and technology, especially in its role in solving unique problems. I am extremely driven and therefore love to tackle challenges of all kinds however ambiguous or ambitious they may seem.

I am an entrepreneur at heart and find myself continually wanting to work on difficult problems. I like being original, strategic, thoughtful in all aspects of design, build and product management. I also enjoy the learning cycle that success and failure has to offer. I seek to be brutally efficient, believe in good-old-fashioned hard work and love to work smart.

Currently reading <i>"The Design of Everyday Things"</i> - Don Norman, and <i>"Small Data"</i> - Martin Lindstrom.
